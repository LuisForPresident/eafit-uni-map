## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

1. GUIs are harder to create than they look.
2. Virtual environments are pretty useful.
3. Use LiveShare to code collaboratively.
4. Check your terminal config files.
5. Don't overdo it with the folders.
6. `CITATION.cff` is a thing
7. `brew update --auto-update` shouldn't exist.
